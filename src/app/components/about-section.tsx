            Most AI companies talk in buzzwords and sell you complicated software that takes months to set up. We&apos;re different.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We build practical AI tools for real businessesâ€”trades, hospitality, retail, professional services, wholesalers. 
            The kind of businesses where every hour counts and nobody has time for tech that doesn&apos;t just work.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Our solutions are simple, fast to implement, and designed to solve the problems that actually keep you up at night: 
            endless admin, chasing payments, missed opportunities, and never having enough hours in the day.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">
            No jargon. No six-month implementation timelines. <span className="text-primary">Just tools that work.</span>

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Gather Materials (30-60 minutes)

**About Document:**

Create a document with:

- Professional background
- Company/role information
- Key values and beliefs
- Target audience
- Content goals
- Industry context

**Content Examples:**

Collect 10-15 examples of their best writing:

- LinkedIn posts (mix of types)
- Emails to clients/customers
- Blog articles
- Social media posts
- Presentations
- Website copy

**Quality over quantity:** Better to have 10 excellent examples than 50 mediocre ones.

### Step 2: Prepare the Input (15 minutes)

Format your materials:

```
# About [Person/Company Name]

[Paste your about document here]

---

# Content Examples

## Example 1: [Type - e.g., LinkedIn Post - Project Announcement]

[Full content here]

## Example 2: [Type]

[Full content here]

[Continue for all examples...]
```

### Step 3: Run the Analysis (5 minutes)

1. Open ChatGPT, Claude, or your preferred AI
2. Copy the metaprompt above
3. Paste your prepared materials
4. Submit and wait for the analysis

**Pro tip:** Use GPT-4 or Claude Opus for best results.

### Step 4: Review and Refine (30-60 minutes)

**Check for:**

- ✅ Specific examples (not vague descriptions)
- ✅ Actionable guidelines (not just observations)
- ✅ Accurate patterns (verify against original content)
- ✅ Complete coverage (all major content types)

**Common issues to fix:**

- Too generic ("professional tone" → specify HOW they're professional)
- Missing examples (add specific phrases from their content)
- Incomplete sections (flesh out thin areas)
- Inaccurate patterns (correct misinterpretations)

### Step 5: Test the Style Guide (30 minutes)

**Create test content:**

1. Pick a topic they haven't written about
2. Use the style guide to create content in their voice
3. Compare to their actual writing
4. Refine the guide based on gaps

### Step 6: Organize and Store (15 minutes)

**Save in multiple formats:**

- Notion page (for easy access and updates)
- Markdown file (for AI prompts)
- PDF (for sharing with team)

**Link to:**

- Client/contact database
- Project folders
- Content creation workflows

## What Makes a GREAT Style Guide?

### ✅ Specific, Not Generic

**Bad:** "Uses a professional tone"

**Good:** "Opens with 'We're proud to announce...' for project completions and always mentions team members by name in the second paragraph"

### ✅ Actionable, Not Descriptive

**Bad:** "Writes about construction projects"

**Good:** "Project announcements follow this structure: (1) Opening with client/project name, (2) Team recognition with full names, (3) Subcontractor list, (4) Forward-looking statement, (5) #deionesuccess hashtag"

### ✅ Example-Rich

**Bad:** "Uses hashtags strategically"

**Good:** "Always ends with branded hashtag #deionesuccess, plus 3-5 industry tags like #construction, #womeninconstruction, #constructingchange. Placement: clustered at end, not inline."

### ✅ Comprehensive

Covers all major content types, communication channels, tone variations, formatting patterns, and language quirks.

### ✅ Testable

You should be able to generate new content using only the guide and have it sound authentic.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Not Enough Examples

**Problem:** Guide says "uses casual tone" but doesn't show HOW

**Solution:** Include 10+ specific phrases and examples

### ❌ Too Much Description, Not Enough Prescription

**Problem:** "They write about technology" (observation)

**Solution:** "Technology posts follow this template: [specific structure]" (instruction)

### ❌ Missing the "Why"

**Problem:** Lists what they do without explaining purpose

**Solution:** "Tags team members to show appreciation AND increase post visibility"

### ❌ Ignoring Anti-Patterns

**Problem:** Only says what TO do

**Solution:** Also specify what NOT to do (AI tells, corporate jargon, etc.)

### ❌ One-Size-Fits-All

**Problem:** Single tone for all content

**Solution:** Different tone guidelines for different content types

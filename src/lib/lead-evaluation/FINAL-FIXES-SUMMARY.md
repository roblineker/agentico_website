# Final Fixes Summary - All Features Now Working!

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Style Guides Not Linking Correctly
**Problem:** 
- Company style guides were linking to Client (correct) ✅
- Contact style guides were linking to Client (WRONG) ❌

**Solution:**
- Company style guides → link to Client ID
- Contact style guides → link to Contact ID
- Route.ts now returns both `clientPageId` and `contactPageId`
- Orchestrator passes correct IDs to each function

### 2. ✅ Proposal Date Property Error
**Problem:**
```
date:Proposal Date:start is not a property that exists
```

**Solution:**
- Changed from `'date:Proposal Date:start'` to `'Proposal Date'`
- Same fix for `'Estimate Date'`
- Notion SDK handles the date conversion automatically

### 3. ✅ Client Lookup API Error  
**Problem:**
```
notion.databases.query is not a function
```

**Solution:**
- Changed from `notion.databases.query()` to `notion.search()`
- Search API is the correct method for finding pages by title
- Added exact match filtering after search

### 4. ✅ PDF Attachments Added
**New Feature:**
- Installed `pdf-lib` for PDF generation
- Created `src/lib/utils/pdf-generator.ts`
- Generates professional PDFs from style guide content
- Automatically attaches PDFs to detailed analysis email
- PDFs include:
  - Company branding
  - Proper formatting (headings, bullet points, paragraphs)
  - Word wrapping
  - Page breaks
  - Metadata (title, author, creation date)

### 5. ✅ Enhanced AI Prompts
**Improvements:**
- Updated prompts to match your style guide templates
- More structured output with clear sections
- Industry-specific recommendations
- Practical examples included
- Better alignment with Notion database properties

    question: "Is this going to be complicated to set up?",
    answer: "Nope. We handle the setup and make sure everything integrates with your existing tools. Most solutions are up and running within a week or two."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be \"tech-savvy\"?",
    answer: "Not at all. If you can use your phone and email, you can use our tools. We build them to be simple."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't know what I need?",
    answer: "That's totally fine. Most of our clients start with \"I just need more time\" or \"I hate doing quotes.\" We help you figure out what would actually make a difference."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer: "It depends on what you need. We start with a $399 workshop where we map out your specific challenges and solutions. From there, we give you a clear quote with no surprises."
  },
  {
    question: "Will this replace my staff?",
    answer: "No. Our tools handle the boring, repetitive stuff so your team can focus on the work that actually requires a human touchâ€”like serving customers, doing quality work, and growing the business."
  },
  {
    question: "What if it doesn't work for my industry?",
    answer: "We'll tell you upfront in the workshop if we don't think we can help. We're not here to sell you something that won't work."

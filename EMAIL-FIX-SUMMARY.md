# Email Fix Summary

## Problem
- ✅ Instant confirmation emails working in production
- ❌ Sales notification emails NOT being sent in production
- ❌ Detailed analysis emails disabled (intentionally)

## Root Cause

The `evaluateAndProcessLead()` function sends the sales notification at **Step 9** - after:
- Lead scoring
- Web presence analysis
- AI research (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Client creation (requires `NOTION_API_TOKEN`)
- Style guide generation (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Proposal creation (requires `NOTION_API_TOKEN`)

**In production, if any of these steps fail or timeout, the sales notification never gets sent.**

Common failure points:
- Missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` → AI research fails
- Missing `NOTION_API_TOKEN` → Client/proposal creation fails
- Serverless function timeout (10-30 seconds) → Process killed before Step 9

## Solution Applied

Moved sales notification to **Step 2.5** (right after lead scoring), making it fire immediately like the instant confirmation.

### Changes Made

**File: `src/lib/lead-evaluation/orchestrator.ts`**

1. **Added early sales notification** (line 199-205):
```typescript
// Step 2.5: Send early sales notification with basic data
// This ensures we always get notified, even if later steps fail
console.log('[ORCHESTRATOR] Sending early sales notification...');
sendSalesNotification(data, result).catch((err) => {
  console.error('[ORCHESTRATOR] Early sales notification error:', err);
  errors.push('Failed to send sales notification');
});
```

2. **Removed late sales notification** (previously Step 9)
3. **Added comprehensive logging** to all email functions:
   - `[EMAIL]` prefix for all email operations
   - Success: `✓ Email sent successfully`
   - Failure: `✗ Failed to send` with error details
   - Missing token: Clear message about configuration

## Testing

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
# Fill contact form with test data
# Check terminal for:
[CONTACT API] Starting lead evaluation for Company Name...
[EMAIL] Sending instant confirmation to email@example.com...
[EMAIL] ✓ Instant confirmation sent successfully
[ORCHESTRATOR] Sending early sales notification...
[EMAIL] Sending sales notification for Company Name...
[EMAIL] ✓ Sales notification sent successfully
```

### Production Testing
1. Submit contact form
2. Check deployment logs:
```bash
vercel logs --follow
# or
netlify functions:log
```
3. Should see the same `[EMAIL]` messages
4. Check email inboxes:
   - Customer should receive instant confirmation
   - sales@agentico.com.au should receive sales notification

## Benefits

✅ **Reliable notifications** - Sales team notified immediately, even if AI/Notion steps fail  
✅ **Better debugging** - Comprehensive logging with `[EMAIL]` prefix  
✅ **Fail-safe** - Email sent before potentially slow/failing operations  
✅ **Maintains instant confirmation** - Customer still gets immediate acknowledgment

## What Emails Are Sent Now

| Email | Recipient | Timing | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Instant Confirmation** | Customer | Immediate (Step 1) | ✅ Active |
| **Sales Notification** | sales@agentico.com.au | Early (Step 2.5) | ✅ Active |
| **Detailed Analysis** | Customer | After all processing | ❌ Disabled |

## Monitoring Production

Check for these log patterns:

### ✅ Success Pattern
```
[CONTACT API] Starting lead evaluation for Company...
[EMAIL] Sending instant confirmation to customer@email.com...
[EMAIL] ✓ Instant confirmation sent successfully
[ORCHESTRATOR] Sending early sales notification...
[EMAIL] Sending sales notification for Company...
[EMAIL] ✓ Sales notification sent successfully
```

### ❌ Missing Token
```
[EMAIL] POSTMARK_API_TOKEN not configured - instant confirmation email NOT sent
[EMAIL] Would have sent to: customer@email.com
```
**Fix:** Add `POSTMARK_API_TOKEN` to production environment

### ❌ Send Failure
```
[EMAIL] ✗ Failed to send sales notification
[EMAIL] Error message: You must verify the sender signature
```
**Fix:** Verify sender domain in Postmark: https://account.postmarkapp.com/signature_domains

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to production** - Changes will take effect immediately
2. **Test with real submission** - Submit contact form in production
3. **Verify both emails received**:
   - Check customer email inbox
   - Check sales@agentico.com.au inbox
4. **Monitor logs** for `[EMAIL]` messages

## Diagnostic Tools

**Check Postmark configuration:**

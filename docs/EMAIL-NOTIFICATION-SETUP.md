## Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:

```env
# Postmark API Token
POSTMARK_API_TOKEN=your-postmark-server-api-token

# Sender email must be verified in Postmark
# Default: noreply@agentico.com.au
```

## Postmark Setup Required

### 1. Verify Sender Domain

In your Postmark account:
1. Go to **Sender Signatures**
2. Add and verify **agentico.com.au** domain
3. Add DNS records as instructed
4. Wait for verification (usually a few minutes)

### 2. Verify Sender Email

Ensure these emails are verified:
- `noreply@agentico.com.au` (sender)
- `sales@agentico.com.au` (recipient)

### 3. Get API Token

1. Go to **Servers** in Postmark
2. Select your server (or create one)
3. Copy the **Server API Token**
4. Add to `.env.local` as `POSTMARK_API_TOKEN`

### 4. Set Message Stream

Emails use the `outbound` message stream (default for transactional emails).

## Error Handling

### Non-Blocking
- Emails are sent asynchronously (non-blocking)
- Form submission succeeds even if emails fail
- Errors are logged but don't affect user experience

### Graceful Degradation
```typescript
if (!postmarkToken) {
  console.warn('Postmark not configured - skipping emails');
  return { success: false, reason: 'not_configured' };
}
```

### Dual Send with Promise.allSettled
```typescript
const results = await Promise.allSettled([
  client.sendEmail(salesEmail),
  client.sendEmail(userEmail),
]);
```

Both emails are attempted independently - if one fails, the other still sends.

## Testing

### Development Testing

With test data dropdown, all test cases use `dev@agentico.com.au`:

## Monitoring

### Console Logs

```

Check server logs to verify:

- Any errors or failures
- Postmark API responses

### Postmark Dashboard

Monitor in Postmark:
- **Activity** - See all sent emails
- **Bounces** - Track delivery issues
- **Opens/Clicks** - Track engagement (if enabled)

## Security & Privacy

### Sender Domain
- Uses verified `noreply@agentico.com.au`
- Prevents spoofing and improves deliverability
- SPF, DKIM, DMARC configured via Postmark

### User Privacy
- Only sends to email provided in form
- Clear unsubscribe/contact information
- Compliant with Australian privacy laws

### Data in Emails
- Contains full submission details for sales team
- User receives summary only (not all internal details)
- No sensitive data stored in email

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

**Check:**
1. `POSTMARK_API_TOKEN` is set in `.env.local`
2. Sender domain verified in Postmark
3. Server logs for specific error messages
4. Postmark account has available credits

### Emails in Spam

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure SPF/DKIM records added to DNS
2. Use verified sender domain
3. Avoid spam trigger words in content
4. Ask recipients to whitelist noreply@agentico.com.au

### Wrong Email Address

**User email:**
- Sent to whatever they enter in form
- Validate email format client-side (already done)

**Sales email:**
- Hardcoded to `sales@agentico.com.au`
- Update in code if needed

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
- Add email templates in Postmark (instead of inline HTML)
- Track email opens and clicks
- Send follow-up emails automatically
- CC additional team members based on industry
- Add calendar invite for discovery call
- Include PDF attachment with submission summary

### Advanced Features
- Trigger different email templates based on budget/timeline
- A/B test email content
- Segment notifications by lead quality
- Integration with CRM for email tracking

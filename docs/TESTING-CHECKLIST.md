- `Could not find database`
- `Unauthorized`
- `Validation failed`

## Performance Check

- [ ] Form submission completes in < 2 seconds
- [ ] Page loads quickly after submission
- [ ] No noticeable delay from Notion integration (runs non-blocking)

## Production Readiness

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All tests pass successfully
- [ ] Notion integration works consistently
- [ ] Environment variables documented for deployment
- [ ] Team members have access to Notion database
- [ ] Backup/alternative tested (N8N webhooks or email)
- [ ] Error monitoring configured
- [ ] Database views set up for team workflow

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Could not find database"
**Solution:** Verify database ID and ensure database is shared with integration

### Issue: "Unauthorized"
**Solution:** Check token is correct and starts with `secret_`

### Issue: Validation failed on select property
**Solution:** Verify all select options exist in Notion database

### Issue: Form succeeds but nothing in Notion
**Solution:** Check server logs for error messages, verify environment variables

### Issue: Some fields missing in Notion
**Solution:** Verify property names match exactly (case-sensitive)

## Success Criteria

All tests must pass:
- ‚úÖ Form submits successfully
- ‚úÖ Data appears in Notion database
- ‚úÖ All fields are populated correctly
- ‚úÖ Page content is formatted properly
- ‚úÖ Optional fields work correctly
- ‚úÖ Different industries work
- ‚úÖ Error handling is graceful
- ‚úÖ Performance is acceptable

## Next Steps After Testing

Once all tests pass:

1. Document any custom Notion database views
2. Set up Notion automation/notifications (if needed)
3. Train team on using Notion database
4. Deploy to production with production credentials
5. Test production deployment
6. Monitor for errors in production logs

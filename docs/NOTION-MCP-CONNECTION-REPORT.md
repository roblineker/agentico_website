## 🔧 Required Actions

### 1. Add Missing Properties to Notion

Add these two properties to the "Client Intake Forms" database:

**Property 1: Website**
- Type: URL
- Description: "Company website URL"

**Property 2: Social Links**
- Type: Rich Text or Text
- Description: "Social media links (optional)"

### 2. Update API Code (Optional)

The database already has most fields, but we need to update the code to use the correct property names:

#### Current Code Uses:
- `Name` → Should be `Submission Name` (title field)
- `Email` → ✅ Matches
- `Phone` → Should be `Phone Number`
- `Company` → Should be `Company Name`
- `Business Size` → Should be `Total Employees`
- `Team Size` → Should be `Team Size Affected`
- `Status` → Should be `Submission Status`
- `Submitted` → Should be `Submission Date`

## 🚀 Recommended Updates

### Update 1: Fix Property Names in Code

```typescript
properties: {
  'Submission Name': { // Changed from 'Name'
    title: [{ text: { content: data.fullName } }],
  },
  'Email': { // ✅ Correct
    email: data.email,
  },
  'Phone Number': { // Changed from 'Phone'
    phone_number: data.phone,
  },
  'Company Name': { // Changed from 'Company'
    rich_text: [{ text: { content: data.company } }],
  },
  'Total Employees': { // Changed from 'Business Size'
    select: { name: data.businessSize },
  },
  'Team Size Affected': { // Changed from 'Team Size'
    select: { name: data.teamSize },
  },
  'Submission Status': { // Changed from 'Status'
    status: { name: 'New' },
  },
  'date:Submission Date:start': new Date().toISOString(), // Changed format
  'date:Submission Date:is_datetime': 1,
}
```

### Update 2: Add Website and Social Links Support

Once you add the properties to Notion:

```typescript
properties: {
  // ... existing properties ...
  'Website': {
    url: data.website || null,
  },
  'Social Links': {
    rich_text: [{
      text: {

   NOTION_API_TOKEN=secret_your_actual_token_here
   ```
3. [ ] Save the file
4. [ ] **Important**: Restart your dev server if it's running

## Part 2: Notion MCP Setup (Optional - For AI Access)

This enables the AI in Cursor to directly access your Notion workspace.

### Step 1: Set System Environment Variable (Windows)

**Option A: PowerShell (Recommended)**
```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("NOTION_API_TOKEN", "secret_your_token_here", "User")
```

**Option B: Windows Settings**
1. [ ] Open Start Menu â†’ Search "environment variables"
2. [ ] Click "Edit the system environment variables"
3. [ ] Click "Environment Variables" button
4. [ ] Under "User variables", click "New"
5. [ ] Variable name: `NOTION_API_TOKEN`
6. [ ] Variable value: `secret_your_token_here`
7. [ ] Click OK

### Step 2: Verify MCP Configuration (Already Done!)

The MCP config is already set up in `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Notion_Agentico": {
      "url": "https://mcp.notion.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${NOTION_API_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Restart Cursor (1 minute)

1. [ ] Close Cursor completely
2. [ ] Reopen Cursor
3. [ ] Environment variable is now loaded

### Step 4: Test MCP Connection (1 minute)

1. [ ] Open AI chat in Cursor
2. [ ] Ask: **"Can you see my Notion databases?"**
3. [ ] AI should list your databases or search for them
4. [ ] Try: **"Show me the latest entries in my Contact Form Submissions database"**

âœ… **Part 2 Complete!** AI can now access your Notion workspace.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Notion credentials not configured"

**Check:**
- [ ] `.env.local` exists in project root
- [ ] `NOTION_API_TOKEN` is set in `.env.local`
- [ ] Token starts with `secret_`
- [ ] No extra spaces or quotes around the token
- [ ] Dev server was restarted after adding variable

### Issue: "Could not find contact form database"

**Check:**
- [ ] Database name includes: "Contact", "Form", "Submission", or "Lead"
- [ ] Database is shared with your integration
- [ ] Integration has Insert, Update, and Read permissions

### Issue: "Validation failed" or property errors

**Check:**
- [ ] All required properties exist in database
- [ ] Property names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- [ ] Select properties have all required options
- [ ] See full property list in [NOTION-SETUP.md](../NOTION-SETUP.md)

### Issue: MCP not working in Cursor

**Check:**
- [ ] `NOTION_API_TOKEN` set as **system environment variable** (not just `.env.local`)
- [ ] Cursor was restarted after setting variable
- [ ] Token is valid and has access to workspace
- [ ] See [NOTION-MCP-SETUP.md](./NOTION-MCP-SETUP.md) for detailed steps

# Notion Integration Summary

## What Was Implemented

The Notion SDK v5 has been successfully integrated into the Agentico website contact form to automatically save all form submissions to a Notion database using the **latest Notion API version `2025-09-03`**.

### API Version

We're using:
- **Notion SDK**: `@notionhq/client` v5.3.0
- **API Version**: `2025-09-03` (latest, with multi-source database support)
- **New Features**: Support for `data_source_id` and multi-source databases

## Files Modified

### 1. `package.json`
- Added `@notionhq/client` dependency (official Notion SDK)

### 2. `src/app/api/contact/route.ts`
- Imported Notion Client SDK
- Updated form schema to match the complete contact form (added website, socialLinks, and all industry options)
- Added `initializeNotion()` function to initialize the Notion client with:
  - Environment variables
  - **Latest API version `2025-09-03`**
- Added `saveToNotion()` function that:
  - **Retrieves database data sources** (new in API 2025-09-03)
  - **Uses `data_source_id`** instead of `database_id` for page creation (required in new API)
  - Creates a new page in the specified Notion database
  - Maps all form fields to Notion database properties
  - Adds detailed content blocks to the page with all form information
  - Formats project ideas with emoji indicators based on priority
  - Handles social links if provided
  - Includes error handling and logging
- Integrated `saveToNotion()` call into the POST handler (non-blocking)

### 3. `README.md`
- Updated features to mention Notion integration
- Added environment variables documentation
- Added Notion API to technologies list
- Updated form integration section

### 4. `NOTION-SETUP.md` (New)
- Comprehensive setup guide for Notion integration
- Step-by-step instructions for creating a Notion integration
- Database schema with all required properties
- Property configuration details (select options, etc.)
- Environment variable setup
- Troubleshooting guide
- Common errors and solutions

## How It Works

1. User submits the contact form
2. Form data is validated using Zod schema
3. Data is saved to Notion database (non-blocking):
   - **Retrieves database and gets data source ID** (API 2025-09-03 requirement)
   - Creates a new database entry using `data_source_id` with contact info, business details, and project scope
   - Adds rich content to the page with all form details
   - Sets initial status to "New"
   - **Compatible with multi-source databases** (future-proof)
4. Data is sent to N8N webhooks (if configured)
5. Success response is returned to the user

## Environment Variables Required

```env
NOTION_API_TOKEN=secret_your_notion_integration_token
```

**That's it!** The database is automatically discovered by searching for databases with "Contact", "Form", "Submission", or "Lead" in the title.

## Notion Database Schema

### Page Content (detailed information):
